### **Clauses and Sentence Structure: Comprehensive Guide**

Understanding clauses and sentence structure is fundamental for creating grammatically correct and expressive sentences. This guide will cover the types of clauses, their roles, and how they fit into different sentence structures.

------

### **1. What Are Clauses?**

A **clause** is a group of words containing a subject and a verb. Clauses can function as complete sentences or parts of sentences.

------

### **2. Types of Clauses**

#### **A. Independent Clauses**

An independent clause expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.

- Examples

  :

  1. I enjoy reading.
  2. She is working hard.

#### **B. Dependent Clauses**

A dependent (subordinate) clause does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone. It depends on an independent clause to make sense.

- Examples

  :

  1. Although it was raining, we went outside.
  2. When the movie ended, we went for coffee.

------

### **3. Types of Dependent Clauses**

#### **A. Adverbial Clauses**

These clauses act as adverbs, modifying verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They answer questions like "when," "why," "how," or "under what conditions."

- Examples

  :

  1. Because he was late, we started without him.
  2. If you work hard, you will succeed.

#### **B. Adjective Clauses**

These clauses act as adjectives, modifying nouns or pronouns. They are introduced by **who, whom, whose, which, that, where, when, or why**.

- Examples

  :

  1. The book **that I borrowed from the library** was excellent.
  2. The woman **who lives next door** is a doctor.

#### **C. Noun Clauses**

These clauses act as nouns and can function as subjects, objects, or complements in a sentence. They are introduced by **what, whatever, who, whoever, that, if, whether**, etc.

- Examples

  :

  1. **What she said** surprised me.
  2. I don’t know **if he will come**.

------

### **4. Sentence Structure**

Sentences are made up of one or more clauses. Understanding the relationship between these clauses helps in forming simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences.

#### **A. Simple Sentences**

Contain one independent clause.

- Examples

  :

  1. The cat is sleeping.
  2. He enjoys playing football.

#### **B. Compound Sentences**

Contain two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (**for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so**) or a semicolon.

- Examples

  :

  1. I wanted to go to the party, but I was too tired.
  2. She studies hard; she always gets good grades.

#### **C. Complex Sentences**

Contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

- Examples

  :

  1. Although it was raining, we decided to go hiking.
  2. She left the party early because she was feeling unwell.

#### **D. Compound-Complex Sentences**

Contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

- Examples

  :

  1. While he was cooking dinner, she cleaned the living room, and the kids played outside.
  2. I went to the park, but because it started raining, I left early.

------

### **5. Punctuation in Sentence Structure**

1. **Comma with Compound Sentences**: Place a comma before the coordinating conjunction.
   - **Example**: I like coffee, but I prefer tea.
2. **Comma with Dependent Clauses**:
   - If the dependent clause comes first, use a comma.
     - **Example**: If it rains, we’ll stay home.
   - If the dependent clause comes after, no comma is needed.
     - **Example**: We’ll stay home if it rains.
3. **Semicolon in Compound Sentences**: Use a semicolon to join two independent clauses without a conjunction.
   - **Example**: I finished my homework; I went to bed.

------

### **6. Common Mistakes in Clauses and Sentence Structure**

#### **A. Sentence Fragments**

A dependent clause left alone is a fragment.

- **Mistake**: Because she was late.
- **Correct**: Because she was late, she missed the train.

#### **B. Run-On Sentences**

Two independent clauses joined without proper punctuation.

- **Mistake**: I love pizza it’s my favorite food.
- **Correct**: I love pizza; it’s my favorite food.

#### **C. Misplaced Modifiers**

Dependent clauses that are not clearly connected to the subject they modify.

- **Mistake**: Walking to school, the rain started pouring.
- **Correct**: Walking to school, I got soaked as the rain started pouring.
