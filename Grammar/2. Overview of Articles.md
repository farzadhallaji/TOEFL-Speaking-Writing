   - Refers to specific or particular nouns.
2. Indefinite Articles ("a" and "an")
   - Refer to nonspecific or general nouns.

### **2. The Definite Article ("the")**

#### **Usage of "the"**:

1. When both the speaker and listener know the specific noun being referred to.
   - Example: **The dog** in the yard is barking.
2. When there is only one of something.
   - Example: **The sun** rises in the east.
3. When referring to something mentioned earlier.
   - Example: I saw a movie. **The movie** was great.
4. Before superlatives and ordinal numbers.
   - Example: She is **the best** student in the class.
5. With unique objects or places.
   - Example: **The Eiffel Tower**, **the Earth**.
6. With groups of people or adjectives acting as nouns.
