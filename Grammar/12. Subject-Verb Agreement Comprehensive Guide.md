### **Subject-Verb Agreement: Comprehensive Guide**

Subject-verb agreement is the grammatical rule that the subject of a sentence must match the verb in **number** (singular or plural) and **person**. Errors in subject-verb agreement can make sentences unclear or incorrect.

------

### **1. Basic Rule**

- A 

  singular subject

   takes a 

  singular verb

  .

  - **Example**: She **works** hard.

- A 

  plural subject

   takes a 

  plural verb

  .

  - **Example**: They **work** hard.

------

### **2. Rules for Subject-Verb Agreement**

#### **A. Singular and Plural Subjects**

- Singular

  : Add 

  -s

   or 

  -es

   to the base verb for singular third-person subjects.

  - **Example**: He **runs** every morning.

- Plural

  : Use the base verb for plural subjects.

  - **Example**: They **run** every morning.

#### **B. Compound Subjects**

1. Subjects joined by 

   and

    are plural.

   - **Example**: Tom and Jerry **are** funny.

2. If the compound subject refers to a single entity or concept, use a singular verb.

   - **Example**: Macaroni and cheese **is** delicious.

------

#### **C. Indefinite Pronouns**

Some indefinite pronouns are singular, some are plural, and some depend on the context.

1. **Singular Pronouns**:

   - Examples

     : Anyone, everyone, someone, no one, each, every, neither, either

     - **Sentence**: Everyone **is** invited to the party.

2. **Plural Pronouns**:

   - Examples

     : Few, many, several, both

     - **Sentence**: Both of them **are** coming.

3. **Context-Dependent Pronouns**:

   - Examples

     : All, some, none, most

     - If referring to a singular noun: All of the cake **is** gone.
     - If referring to a plural noun: All of the cookies **are** gone.

------

#### **D. Collective Nouns**

1. A collective noun is treated as singular if the group acts as a single unit.
   - **Example**: The team **wins** every match.
2. It is treated as plural if the members act individually.
   - **Example**: The team **are** arguing among themselves.

------

#### **E. Subjects Separated from Verbs**

Ignore extra phrases or clauses between the subject and the verb. The verb agrees with the main subject.

- **Example**:
   The bouquet of roses **is** beautiful.
   (The subject is "bouquet," not "roses.")

------

#### **F. Inverted Subjects**

When the subject comes after the verb, ensure agreement.

- **Example**:
   There **is** a problem with the report.
   There **are** many issues to discuss.

------

#### **G. Titles and Names**

Titles of books, movies, or organizations take a singular verb, even if plural in form.

- **Example**:
   "The Chronicles of Narnia" **is** a popular series.

------

#### **H. Subjects with Quantifiers**

Words like "a lot of," "some of," or "none of" depend on the noun following them.

- **Examples**:
   A lot of water **is** needed.
   A lot of students **are** present.

------

### **3. Common Mistakes**

#### **A. Misidentifying the Subject**

- **Mistake**: The group of students **are** playing.
- **Correct**: The group of students **is** playing.

#### **B. Ignoring Singular Indefinite Pronouns**

- **Mistake**: Everyone **know** the answer.
- **Correct**: Everyone **knows** the answer.

#### **C. Confusing Collective Nouns**

- **Mistake**: The jury **is** arguing among itself.
- **Correct**: The jury **are** arguing among themselves.

#### **D. Overgeneralizing with "And"**

- **Mistake**: Bread and butter **are** my breakfast.
- **Correct**: Bread and butter **is** my breakfast.

------

### **4. Advanced Subject-Verb Agreement**

#### **A. Fractions and Percentages**

The verb agrees with the noun following "of."

- **Examples**:
   One-third of the cake **is** gone.
   Fifty percent of the students **are** present.

#### **B. Singular Plural Forms**

Some nouns have singular forms but plural meanings, and vice versa.

- **Examples**:
   The news **is** shocking.
   Mathematics **is** difficult.
   Scissors **are** sharp.

#### **C. Expressions Starting with "Each" or "Every"**

Always take a singular verb.

- **Example**:
   Each of the students **has** a book.

------
