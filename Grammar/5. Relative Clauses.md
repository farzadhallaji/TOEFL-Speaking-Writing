Here’s a **comprehensive guide to Relative Clauses**, organized to gradually build your understanding and cover everything you need to learn about them.

------

### **What Are Relative Clauses?**

Relative clauses give additional information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. They make sentences more informative and interesting by connecting ideas.

#### **Examples**:

1. The boy **who is playing in the garden** is my brother.
2. This is the book **that I borrowed from the library**.
3. She lives in a city **where the weather is always pleasant**.

------

### **Types of Relative Clauses**

#### **1. Defining Relative Clauses**

These clauses provide essential information about the noun. Without this clause, the sentence would be incomplete or unclear.

- **Relative Pronouns**:
   **Who** (people), **which** (things), **that** (people/things), **whose** (possession), **where** (places), **when** (time).

#### Examples:

- The girl **who is wearing a red dress** is my sister.
- I lost the keys **that I used to open the door**.
- Do you know the place **where he works**?
- This is the man **whose car was stolen**.
- We will never forget the day **when we met**.

------

#### **2. Non-Defining Relative Clauses**

These clauses add extra, non-essential information about the noun. They are separated by commas. Removing the clause does not change the main meaning of the sentence.

- **Relative Pronouns**: **Who, which, whose, where, when** (but never "that").

#### Examples:

- My mother, **who is a great cook**, made a delicious meal.
- This book, **which I bought yesterday**, is very interesting.
- Paris, **where I spent my childhood**, is a beautiful city.
- The movie, **whose director won an award**, was fantastic.

------

### **Relative Pronouns and Their Functions**

| Relative Pronoun | Refers To       | Example                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Who**          | People          | The teacher **who teaches math** is kind.    |
| **Whom**         | People (formal) | The person **whom I invited** is here.       |
| **Whose**        | Possession      | This is the girl **whose phone was stolen**. |
| **Which**        | Things/Animals  | The car, **which is red**, is very fast.     |
| **That**         | People/Things   | This is the book **that I told you about**.  |
| **Where**        | Places          | The café **where we met** was lovely.        |
| **When**         | Time            | 2001 was the year **when I graduated**.      |
| **Why**          | Reason          | That’s the reason **why I left early**.      |

------

### **Omitting Relative Pronouns**

You can omit the relative pronoun when it functions as the object of the clause.

#### Examples:

- The book **that I borrowed** is on the table.
   → The book **I borrowed** is on the table.
- The woman **whom we met yesterday** is nice.
   → The woman **we met yesterday** is nice.

------

### **Reduced Relative Clauses**

Relative clauses can be shortened by removing the relative pronoun and auxiliary verb.

#### Examples:

- The man **who is standing there** is my uncle.
   → The man **standing there** is my uncle.
- The house **which was built in 1900** is still standing.
   → The house **built in 1900** is still standing.

------

### **Prepositions in Relative Clauses**

Prepositions can come before the relative pronoun (formal) or at the end of the clause (informal).

#### Examples:

- This is the house **in which I was born**. (Formal)
- This is the house **I was born in**. (Informal)
- The person **to whom I spoke** was very helpful. (Formal)
- The person **I spoke to** was very helpful. (Informal)

------

### **Advanced Uses**

#### 1. **Combining Multiple Relative Clauses**

- The city **where I grew up**, **which is famous for its architecture**, attracts many tourists.

#### 2. **Relative Clauses with Quantifiers**

- There are many students **most of whom are studying hard**.
- The book contains stories **none of which are boring**.

#### 3. **Relative Clauses with "Whom" (Formal Use)**

- The professor **whom I admire the most** is retiring.

------

### **Reduced Relative Clauses: Rules and Comprehensive Guide**

Reduced relative clauses are shorter forms of relative clauses that omit the relative pronoun and auxiliary verb. They make sentences more concise and are often used in formal or academic writing.

------

### **1. When Can You Reduce a Relative Clause?**

You can reduce a relative clause if:

1. The relative pronoun is **subject** or **object** of the clause.
2. The relative clause is active (not passive) for most cases.
3. There’s no ambiguity in meaning after reduction.

------

### **2. Reduction Rules Based on Verb Forms**

#### **A. Active Voice**

If the relative clause describes an action in progress (using **who is/are**, **which is/are**, or **that is/are**), drop the pronoun and auxiliary verb and change the main verb to its **-ing** form.

- **Full Clause**: The man **who is standing** by the door is my uncle.
   **Reduced Clause**: The man **standing** by the door is my uncle.
- **Full Clause**: The students **who are studying** in the library are very quiet.
   **Reduced Clause**: The students **studying** in the library are very quiet.

#### **B. Passive Voice**

If the relative clause is in the passive voice (using **who is/was**, **which is/was**, or **that is/was** + past participle), drop the pronoun and auxiliary verb and retain the past participle.

- **Full Clause**: The house **which was built** in 1900 is still standing.
   **Reduced Clause**: The house **built** in 1900 is still standing.
- **Full Clause**: The report **that was written** by the professor is excellent.
   **Reduced Clause**: The report **written** by the professor is excellent.

#### **C. "Having" for Perfect Forms**

When the relative clause indicates a completed action (using **who has/have**, **which has/have**, or **that has/have**), you can use **having + past participle**.

- **Full Clause**: The woman **who has completed** the course will graduate.
   **Reduced Clause**: The woman **having completed** the course will graduate.
- **Full Clause**: The student **who had finished** the test left the room.
   **Reduced Clause**: The student **having finished** the test left the room.

------

### **3. Special Cases**

#### **A. Relative Clauses with Prepositions**

If a preposition precedes the relative pronoun, you can reduce the clause but ensure the meaning remains clear.

- **Full Clause**: The room **in which she sleeps** is small.
   **Reduced Clause**: The room **she sleeps in** is small.
- **Full Clause**: The project **for which they are responsible** is challenging.
   **Reduced Clause**: The project **they are responsible for** is challenging.

#### **B. Relative Clauses Describing Time or Place**

You can reduce clauses with **when** and **where** by dropping the pronoun and auxiliary verb, provided the sentence remains clear.

- **Full Clause**: The year **when she was born** is a mystery.
   **Reduced Clause**: The year **she was born** is a mystery.
- **Full Clause**: The city **where I live** is very crowded.
   **Reduced Clause**: The city **I live in** is very crowded.

#### **C. Relative Clauses with Quantifiers**

Quantifiers such as **all of, some of, many of, most of** can remain while reducing the clause.

- **Full Clause**: The books **most of which were borrowed** are overdue.
   **Reduced Clause**: The books, **most of which were borrowed**, are overdue.
- **Full Clause**: The guests **some of whom were late** missed dinner.
   **Reduced Clause**: The guests, **some of whom were late**, missed dinner.

------

### **4. Conditions Where Reduction Is Not Possible**

1. **Non-Defining Relative Clauses**:
    Non-defining clauses often cannot be reduced because they include additional, non-essential information.
   - ❌ My brother, **who is an engineer**, lives in London.
   - ✅ Cannot reduce to: My brother, **an engineer**, lives in London.
2. **When Meaning Becomes Unclear**:
    Avoid reducing if it creates ambiguity.
   - **Full Clause**: The book **that belongs to Sarah** is missing.
   - ❌ Reduced Clause: The book **belonging to Sarah** is missing. (Ambiguity: It might imply the book is actively belonging.)
3. **Clauses with Modal Verbs**:
    Reduction is not possible with modals like **can, should, will, must, etc.**
   - **Full Clause**: The man **who must stay here** is responsible.
   - ❌ Cannot reduce.

------

### **5. Advanced Examples**

#### **A. Complex Sentences**

- **Full Clause**: The woman **who was walking her dog** saw the accident.
   **Reduced Clause**: The woman **walking her dog** saw the accident.
- **Full Clause**: The experiments **that were conducted over five years** provided valuable insights.
   **Reduced Clause**: The experiments **conducted over five years** provided valuable insights.

#### **B. Multiple Clauses in One Sentence**

- **Full Clause**: The house, **which was built in 1900**, **where I grew up**, is now a museum.
   **Reduced Clause**: The house, **built in 1900**, **where I grew up**, is now a museum.

#### **C. Reduced with Quantifiers**

- **Full Clause**: The proposals, **most of which were rejected**, were not feasible.
   **Reduced Clause**: The proposals, **most of which were rejected**, were not feasible.

------

Let’s delve deeper into **reduced relative clauses** with more rules, explanations, and examples to cover every detail comprehensively.

------

### **1. Understanding Relative Clauses Before Reduction**

Before reducing a relative clause, ensure the following:

- The relative clause is modifying a noun or pronoun.
- The clause contains a relative pronoun (**who, which, that, whose, where, when**) and possibly an auxiliary verb (**is, was, has, etc.**).

#### **Examples:**

1. The man **who is standing there** is my uncle.
2. The house **which was built in 1900** is still standing.

------

### **2. Types of Reduction**

#### **A. Reduction of Subject Relative Clauses**

- When the relative pronoun acts as the **subject** of the clause.
- The main verb changes to the **-ing** form or remains in the **past participle** (for passive voice).

##### Active Voice:

- **Full Clause**: The boy **who is running** is very fast.
   **Reduced Clause**: The boy **running** is very fast.

##### Passive Voice:

- **Full Clause**: The building **which was damaged** in the fire has been repaired.
   **Reduced Clause**: The building **damaged** in the fire has been repaired.

------

#### **B. Reduction of Object Relative Clauses**

- When the relative pronoun acts as the **object** of the clause, omit the pronoun and auxiliary verb entirely.

##### Active Voice:

- **Full Clause**: The book **that I read** was amazing.
   **Reduced Clause**: The book **I read** was amazing.

##### Passive Voice:

- **Full Clause**: The invitations **that were sent by email** reached everyone.
   **Reduced Clause**: The invitations **sent by email** reached everyone.

------

#### **C. Reduction of Relative Clauses with Prepositions**

- Prepositions linked to the relative pronoun can remain in the clause.

##### Examples:

- **Full Clause**: The room **in which she slept** was cozy.
   **Reduced Clause**: The room **she slept in** was cozy.
- **Full Clause**: The company **for which he worked** closed down.
   **Reduced Clause**: The company **he worked for** closed down.

------

#### **D. Reduction of Time and Place Clauses**

- **Where** or **when** can often be omitted, but the meaning must remain clear.

##### Examples:

- **Full Clause**: The house **where they lived** is now empty.
   **Reduced Clause**: The house **they lived in** is now empty.
- **Full Clause**: The year **when we graduated** was unforgettable.
   **Reduced Clause**: The year **we graduated** was unforgettable.

------

#### **E. Reduction of Clauses with "Having"**

- Use **having + past participle** to indicate actions that were completed before the main action.

##### Examples:

- **Full Clause**: The student **who has finished his exam** left the room.
   **Reduced Clause**: The student **having finished his exam** left the room.
- **Full Clause**: The woman **who had already arrived** was waiting for us.
   **Reduced Clause**: The woman **having already arrived** was waiting for us.

------

#### **F. Reduction of Non-Defining Relative Clauses**

- Non-defining clauses often provide extra information but are harder to reduce. Only reduce if the clause is clear and concise.

##### Examples:

- **Full Clause**: My brother, **who is a doctor**, lives in London.
   **Reduced Clause**: My brother, **a doctor**, lives in London.
- **Full Clause**: The Eiffel Tower, **which is located in Paris**, is famous.
   **Reduced Clause**: The Eiffel Tower, **located in Paris**, is famous.

------

### **3. Common Scenarios and Exceptions**

#### **A. Ambiguity in Reduction**

Avoid reducing a clause if the reduction creates ambiguity or changes the meaning.

##### Example 1:

- **Full Clause**: The car **that belongs to Sarah** is new.
- **Incorrect Reduced Clause**: The car **belonging to Sarah** is new.
   **Why?** It may imply Sarah actively owns it now, which could be ambiguous.

##### Example 2:

- **Full Clause**: The man **who was injured in the accident** is recovering.
- **Incorrect Reduced Clause**: The man **injured in the accident** is recovering.
   **Why?** It could imply the injury is ongoing.

------

#### **B. Incompatibility with Modal Verbs**

Reduction is not possible with modal verbs like **can, must, should**.

- **Full Clause**: The person **who must leave early** is John.
- **Cannot Reduce**: The person **must leaving early** is John. (Incorrect)

------

#### **C. Reduction Not Needed for One-Word Modifiers**

If a non-reduced relative clause already uses a single word as a descriptor, reduction is unnecessary.

- **Full Clause**: The student **who is intelligent** scored well.
- **Already Reduced**: The intelligent student scored well.

------

### **4. Advanced Examples**

#### **Active Voice**

    → The bridge **built last year** is already in use.

#### **Perfect Aspect**

1. The man **who has completed his degree** is applying for jobs.
    → The man **having completed his degree** is applying for jobs.
2. The student **who had studied hard** aced the test.
    → The student **having studied hard** aced the test.

#### **Prepositions**

1. The chair **on which she sat** was broken.
    → The chair **she sat on** was broken.
2. The hotel **in which we stayed** was luxurious.
    → The hotel **we stayed in** was luxurious.

#### **Time/Place Clauses**

1. The year **when we graduated** was unforgettable.
    → The year **we graduated** was unforgettable.
2. The house **where I grew up** has been sold.
    → The house **I grew up in** has been sold.
