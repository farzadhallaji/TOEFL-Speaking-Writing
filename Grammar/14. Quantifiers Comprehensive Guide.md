The correct sentence is:

**"Is there any sugar left?"**

### Why?

- Sugar

   is an 

  uncountable noun

  , so it takes a singular verb (

  is

  ).

  - **Example**: Is there any water in the bottle?

If you are talking about countable items, such as **sugar cubes**, you would use **are**:

- **Example**: Are there any sugar cubes left?

### Key Rule:

- Use **is** for uncountable nouns.
- Use **are** for plural countable nouns.
