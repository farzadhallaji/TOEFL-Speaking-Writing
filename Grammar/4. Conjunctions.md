Here’s a detailed guide to **Conjunctions** with explanations, examples, and exercises.

### **1. What Are Conjunctions?**

Conjunctions are words used to connect:

- **Words**: Jack **and** Jill.
- **Phrases**: Walking **and** talking.
- **Clauses**: I wanted to help, **but** I didn’t know how.

------

### **2. Types of Conjunctions**

#### **A. Coordinating Conjunctions**

These join two or more elements of equal importance.

- **FANBOYS**: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.

#### **Examples**:

1. She wants to go to the park, **but** it’s raining.
2. You can have tea **or** coffee.
3. I was tired, **so** I went to bed early.

------

#### **B. Subordinating Conjunctions**

These connect a dependent clause (subordinate clause) to an independent clause.

#### Common Subordinating Conjunctions:

- Cause/Reason

  : because, since, as.

  - I stayed home **because** it was raining.

- Time

  : when, while, before, after, until.

  - Call me **when** you arrive.

- Condition

  : if, unless, provided that.

  : although, even though, though.

  - **Although** it was late, she kept working.

- Purpose/Result

  : so that, in order that.

  - She left early **so that** she could catch the train.

#### **C. Correlative Conjunctions**

These come in pairs and work together to join elements.

#### Common Correlative Conjunctions:

- either...or
- neither...nor
- both...and
- not only...but also
- whether...or

#### Examples:

1. You can **either** stay here **or** come with me.

### **3. Rules for Using Conjunctions**

1. **Don’t overuse coordinating conjunctions**:
   - ❌ I wanted to go, **and** I was late, **and** it started raining.
   - ✅ I wanted to go, **but** I was late, **and** it started raining.
2. **Avoid sentence fragments after subordinating conjunctions**:
   - ❌ **Because** I was tired.
   - ✅ I didn’t go out **because** I was tired.
3. **Match pairs of correlative conjunctions**:
   - ❌ She is **either** coming **nor** staying.
   - ✅ She is **either** coming **or** staying.

------

### **4. Common Mistakes**

1. Using a coordinating conjunction without a comma in compound sentences:
   - ❌ I was hungry **but** I didn’t eat.
   - ✅ I was hungry, **but** I didn’t eat.
2. Mixing up correlative pairs:
   - ❌ You can **either** have coffee **and** tea.
   - ✅ You can **either** have coffee **or** tea.
3. Using subordinating conjunctions redundantly:
   - ❌ **Although** she was late, **but** she still attended the meeting.
   - ✅ **Although** she was late, she still attended the meeting.
