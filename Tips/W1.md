**Response:** "The article claims that the Great Zimbabwe Ruins were constructed by foreigners, citing architectural similarities to foreign styles, the lack of advanced tools, and local myths. However, the lecturer refutes these points by providing evidence that the ruins were built by indigenous Africans.

First, the passage argues that the architectural style of the ruins is similar to foreign structures. In contrast, the professor explains that the stone construction techniques match local African methods used in other nearby sites, which confirms that they were built by local people.

Second, the reading suggests that the lack of advanced tools implies foreign builders. However, the lecturer counters this by stating that simple tools were sufficient for the construction and that local artisans were highly skilled.

Lastly, the article references myths claiming that the ruins were built by foreigners. The professor refutes this, pointing out that these myths were fabricated by colonizers to discredit African achievements.
