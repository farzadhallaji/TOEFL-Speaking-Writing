Discourse markers (connecting words or phrases) help your responses flow smoothly and sound coherent. Examples include:

Mastering these will help you organize your responses effortlessly.

#### 2. **Diversify Sentence Structures**

Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences:

- **Simple:** "I prefer online classes."
- **Compound:** "I prefer online classes because they are convenient, and they save me time."
- **Complex:** "Although in-person classes provide better interaction, I believe online classes are more suitable because of their flexibility."

A variety of structures makes your response sound natural and fluent.

------

Idioms can add flavor to your speech, but use them correctly and sparingly to avoid sounding forced:

- "A blessing in disguise" (unexpected benefit).
- "The ball is in your court" (your turn to make a decision).
